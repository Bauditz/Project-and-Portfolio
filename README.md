# Project-and-Portfolio
The place where i keep my projects. With web, JS and C#.

Hello World! - Just kidding, welcome to my place.
Here I will try to keep some projects, using two majors language. The JavaScript (TypeScript) and a little of C# (For gaming and maybe Back-end).

It's been a while since i uploaded something here in github... you know, sometimes we get our own bad times, and I was on that, feeling like nothing was making sense in coding, but, here I'm again, trying to learn it again!
